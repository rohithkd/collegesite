            <img src="images/clubs/macs.png" style="float:right; margin-right:5px; margin-left:5px; height:20%; width:20%;" />
            <p> MEC Association of Computer Students (MACS) was created by the students of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. MACS was conceived with a vision to inculcate aptitude for the subject among students and create an awareness about the intricacies of the field. It aims to educate the students on the advancements in the industry and learn concepts that aren't part of the curriculum. </p>
            <p>MACS facilitates the participation of students in inter-college events and initiates similar events in the college. The association is presently involved in a couple of projects and activities that are associated with the day to day functioning of the college. It maintains the web, mail and DNS servers in the college, along with the official website.</p>
            <p>The 'Linux Week' is conducted every year by MACS to get the students and the public introduced and familiarized with the operating system. Foss meet @ MEC, the Free and Open Source Software meet was conducted for the first time at the college campus as part of the annual Tech fest of Model Engineering College - Excel 2k9. The meet is an event that brings together FOSS enthusiasts from all over to share their ideas and help promote the FOSS movement.</p>

            <h4 class="deptcont line">Recent Projects</h4><br>
            <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
              <li class="dept-style"><span style="font-weight:400;">Optimizing C compiler for .NET</span><br/> 
              The aim of the project is to implement a reasonable and retargetable optimizing compiler. This compiler is meant to be used along with the "ROTOR" framework and will provide for a C compiler that outputs MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Language).</li><br>
              <li class="dept-style"><span style="font-weight:400;">BIOCLUSTERS- Role of Cluster Computing in Bioinformatics</span><br/> 
              The project looks into the prospects of parallelising two major applications in bioinformatics on Beowulf clusters. These applications are chosen to be representatives of two problems groups that involve performing either large number of non computer intensive tasks (eg: performing BLAST searchs in database) or, a single task requiring huge computational power (eg: Protein folding simulation).</li><br>
              <li class="dept-style"><span style="font-weight:400;">32 Bit Operating System</span><br/> 
              The project is an attempt to build a 32 bit protected mode operating system based on the UNIX Kernel architecture.</li><br>
              <li class="dept-style"><span style="font-weight:400;">High Performance Cluster Computing - "SRISHTI" </span><br/> 
              It aims to demonstrate clusters as a viable alternative to MPPS (Massively Parallel Processors). It explores alternatives to TCP/IP in the form of GAMMA allowing a drastic reduction in network latency by eliminating a lot of the protocol overhead. It provides the basic framework for development of parallel programs based on message passing architecture. The ease of application development on the cluster is further enhanced by the indigenous Object Oriented Master Slave Library, MSLIB.</li><br> 
              <li class="dept-style"><span style="font-weight:400;">Spam Filtering Using Spam Mail Communities </span><br/>
              This project describes an approach towards spam filtering that seeks to exploit the nature of spam messages that allow them to be classified into different communities.</li><br>
              <li class="dept-style"><span style="font-weight:400;">Specialization Scores For Asymmetric Web Search Queries </span><br/>
             This is an approach to compute the specialization score for search queries, the aim of the score being to indicate how specialized the narrow topic is, to the broader topic.The approach generates scores for such queries, which can further be used to refine web searches for such queries, provided a given query could be identified to be of the form that we deal with.</li><br>
              <li class="dept-style"><span style="font-weight:400;">Context Disambiguation in Web Search Results </span><br/>
                 Web searches results in many pages that are not of interest, these may be due to a word or words in the search query having different contexts, the user obviously expecting to find pages related to the context of interest. This work proposes a method for disambiguating contexts in web search results.
